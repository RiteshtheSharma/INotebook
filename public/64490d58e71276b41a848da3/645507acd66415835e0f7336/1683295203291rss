      <title>Do you remember the &quot;institutional&quot; and social media corpo response in the first half of 2020 when someone contradicted the consensus? They were punished for the &quot;crime&quot; of &quot;disinformation.&quot;

Corporations must never again be permitted to police speech.

      <title>RT by @Snowden: But the fight is not over.

Instead of reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the law used to justify this unconstitutional spying, Congress must fundamentally reform this law or let it expire when they vote on it at the end of the year.</title>

      <title>R to @thomashawk: Her account got unlocked overnight. Wish we&apos;d get more policy transparency on what exactly happened and how Twitter will ensure other people won&apos;t run into this same kind of thing in the future, but at least the mistake was reversed. Thanks, @elonmusk.</title>

      <title>R to @Snowden: It seems to me the result of an algorithm run amok, rather than human decision. Wife asks me if she should just give up, delete the pic and move on. I say no--because how many others have been victimized by the same stupid algo?

This is a problem, and it needs to be fixed.</title>

      <title>My wife&apos;s Twitter has been locked for a week for posting a baby picture. She appealed the ban. I mentioned it to @TwitterSupport. I mentioned it to @ElonMusk. Zero response.

Instagram etc have no prob with the same pic.

You can put *porn* on Twitter, but not a baby? Bad policy.</title>
